The event related to the art work is Battle of Playa Girón and it took Place at Playa Girón, Matanzas on 17-19/04/1961. It had Participants Cuban leaders and militiamen and Brigade 2506.

The goal of the invasion was to overthrow Cuba's revolutionary government and establish a pro-American government on the island. The Battle of Playa Girón was an important turning point in the history of Cuba and in relations between Cuba and the United States. The failure of the invasion strengthened the position of the Cuban government and increased hostility between Cuba and the United States. Furthermore, the battle demonstrated the determination and ability of the Cuban government to defend its revolution against foreign intervention.
